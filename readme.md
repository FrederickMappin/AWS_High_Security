## This will be done manually for demo, for full scale we would use cloudformation to make "infrastructure as code"

## Step 0. IAM group & User set-up
### Goal: Set-up minimum required access to AWS services 


# Step 1.VPC set-up 
### Goal: Set-up Virtual Private Cloud without Internet Access for maximum security

```

# Step 2. Private Subnet set-up
```

Subnet 1: Private Subnet AZ1
Name: rna-seq-private-subnet-az1
VPC: rna-seq-hipaa-vpc
Availability Zone: us-east-1a 
IPv6: None

Auto-assign public IPv4 address: Disabled (leave unchecked)
